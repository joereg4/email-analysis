## What We Built
A simple, clean web interface for the Email Analysis API that includes:

### âœ… Features
- **Drag & Drop Upload**: Easy file upload with visual feedback
- **File Selection**: Click to browse and select files
- **Real-time Analysis**: Connects to our working API
- **Visual Results**: Color-coded risk levels and detailed analysis
- **Sample Files**: Quick access to test different email types

### ðŸŽ¨ UI Components
- **Upload Area**: Drag and drop zone with hover effects
- **Email Information**: Displays subject, sender, recipient, date, body preview
- **Risk Analysis**: Color-coded risk levels (SAFE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- **Risk Reasons**: Detailed list of why an email is flagged as suspicious
- **Sample Files**: Quick buttons to test with different email types

### ðŸ§ª How to Test
1. **Open the UI**: The file `simple-ui.html` should be open in your browser
2. **Upload a file**: 
   - Drag and drop one of the sample .eml files onto the upload area
   - Or click "Choose File" and select a file
3. **Click "Analyze Email"**: The UI will send the file to our API
4. **View Results**: See the email details and risk analysis

### ðŸ“§ Test Files Available
- `safe_email.eml` - Business email (should show SAFE risk level)
- `suspicious_email.eml` - Phishing attempt (should show HIGH risk level)  
- `sample.eml` - Basic test email (should show SAFE risk level)

### ðŸ”— API Connection
- UI connects to: `http://localhost:8080`
- Uses the same API endpoints we tested with curl
- Real-time analysis with visual feedback

## Next Steps
The UI is now working and connected to our proven API. You can:
1. Test it with the sample files
2. Upload your own .eml files
3. See the risk analysis in a user-friendly format

This gives you a complete working system: API + UI + Testing!
